.. Gas ORM documentation [example]

An Example Application
========================

OK, so you've read the documentation (especially the sections on conventions, finder and CRUD) and now you want to see how it all fits together! Well you've come to the right place.  This is a simple example application which follows the standard "hello world" of web programming by building a basic blog application.  During this tutorial, we'll build a couple of models, a controller and a few views.  This isn't aimed at somebody who is new to CodeIgniter, but somebody who has used it before and just wants to see how Gas works.


Installing Gas
++++++++++++++

This example isn't going to describe how to install Gas as this is already described in detail in the :doc:`Configuration <configuration>` and :doc:`Quick Start <quickstart>` sections.  If you are having issues getting Gas installed then head on over to the CodeIgniter forum and ask a few questions.


The Blog Structure
++++++++++++++++++

To start with we are just going to create a simple blog.  There will be blog and user tables (and models), a blog controller with some actions:

+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
|    **Action**    |              **Decription**               |
+==================+===========================================+
|     **view**     | View a blog posting without editing       |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
|     **edit**     | Edit an existing blog posting             |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
|    **create**    | Create a new blog posting                 |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+


The Database
++++++++++++

I'm going to assume you know how to connect to a database in CodeIgniter by editing the **config/database.php** file.  Once you have connected properly then you can run the following MySQL script to build the database :  ::

	--
	-- Table structure for table `blog`
	--

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `blog`;
	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `blog` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  `body` text NOT NULL,
	  `modified_at` datetime NOT NULL,
	  `created_at` datetime NOT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;

	-- --------------------------------------------------------

	--
	-- Table structure for table `user`
	--

	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `user`;
	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `user` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `username` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
	  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;


As you can see we have defined a **blog** and a **user** table which will be used to run our simple application.


The Models
+++++++++++

The first thing we need to do is to build our models to describe the blog and user tables.  These should normally reside in your **application/models** folder in your CodeIgniter base directory.  Create a new file here called **user.php** and paste the following code into it: ::

	<?php 
	
	namespace Model;

	use \Gas\Core;
	use \Gas\ORM;

	class User extends ORM {
		
		public $primary_key = 'id';
		
		function _init()
		{
			
			self::$relationships = array (
				'blog'          =>     ORM::has_many('\\Model\\Blog');
			);
			
			self::$fields = array(
				'id' 			=> 		ORM::field('auto[10]'),
				'username' 		=> 		ORM::field('char[64]'),
				'password' 		=> 		ORM::field('char[255]'),
				'email' 		=> 		ORM::field('char[255]'),
			);
		}
	}

This a fairly basic model which describes the user table and doesn't do much else.  The line ::

	public $primary_key = 'id';

Just tells Gas what the name of the primary key is.  Further down, the relationships that this model has with other models (or just our blog one in this case) are defined using the line that starts with ::

	self::$relationships = array()
	
This tells Gas that the user model is related to the blog model using a 'has_many' relationship.

Finally we define our fields by using ::

	self::$fields = array()

In this array each field in our table has its own array element.  In this case we have just used the default types - **auto** for an autoincremented integer field, **int** for a standard integer and **char** for varchar.  You can define your types more explicitly, but in most cases these basic declarations are sufficient.  

.. note:: If you want to know more about the various data types available, have a look at the :doc:`Data Types and Validation <validation>` section of the documentation.

Next we can follow the same process to define our blog model.  Create a new file in application/models called **blog.php** and paste the following code in to it: ::

	<?php namespace Model;

	use \Gas\Core;
	use \Gas\ORM;

	class Blog extends ORM {
		
		public $primary_key = 'id';
		
		function _init()
		{
			
			self::$relationships = array (
				'user'          	=>     ORM::belongs_to('\\Model\\User');
			);
			
			self::$fields = array(
				'id' 			=> 		ORM::field('auto[10]'),
				'title' 		=> 		ORM::field('char[255]', array('required','max_length[255]')),
				'body'	 		=> 		ORM::field('string'),
				'modified_at'		=>		ORM::field('datetime'),
				'created_at'		=>		ORM::field('datetime'),
			);
			
			$this->ts_fields('modified_at','[created_at]');
		}
	}

Note that this is fairly similar to our user model, with a few minor changes.  For instance, our relationship in the blog model is the opposite of the relationship in the user model - user **has_many** blogs, and blogs **belongs_to** user!

There are also a few new types specified in our fields section.  We have a **string** which is the equivalent of a MySQL TEXT field, and two **datetime** fields for storing our creation date and modification date.  The line: ::

	$this->ts_fields('modified_at','[created_at]');

tells Gas that the **modified_at** should be used for saving our edit datetime, whilst **[created_at]** (because it is inside the square brackets) should be used to save our creation time for the record.

Note that we've also placed a second argument inside the title ORM::field section: ::

	array('required','max_length[255]')

If you have used CodeIgniter's form_validation class then this should be familiar to you - they are basic validation rules! We'll come back to this later but basically these allow you to do form_validation with just a simple Gas call to *save()*. 

With just this simple bit of setup, Gas now has basically everything it needs to start working with our database, but to do this we are going to have to build some controllers and views!


Viewing All Our Posts
+++++++++++++++++++++

So we've got our models and our database set up ready to go.  The first thing we want to do is view all our blog posts in the database.  Start by building a controller to handle the requests ::

	<?php if (!defined('BASEPATH')) die ('No direct script access allowed!'); 
	
	class Blog extends CI_Controller
	{
		public function __construct()
		{
			parent::__construct();
		}

		/*
		 * Displays all of the blog posts in a table
		 */
		public function index()
		{
			// load all of our posts
			$data['posts'] = Model\Blog::all();

			// build our blog table
			$data['content'] = $this->load->view('view_many_posts', $data, TRUE);

			// show the main template
			$this->load->view('main_template', $data, TRUE);
		}
	}

Not a whole lot happening here - we define a controller, call the parent constructor and then build a simple index function which gets all our blog posts from the database and displays them.  The line ::

	$data['posts'] = Model\Blog::all();

is where all the magic happens.  We can use all of the CodeIgniter Active Record calls, so for instance if we wanted the last five created posts we could modify this line to be ::

	$data['posts'] = Model\Blog::limit(5)->order_by('created_at', 'DESC')->all();

Of course you know as well as I do that if we load up {your base url}/index.php/blog/ we'll just get a whole bunch of errors saying our views aren't found.  Some basic views we could use are given below: ::

	<!-- view_many_posts.php -->
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Post ID</th>
				<th>Post Title</th>
				<th>&nbsp;</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<?php foreach($posts as $post) : ?>
			<tr>
				<td><?php echo $post->id; ?></td>
				<td><?php echo $post->title; ?></td>
				<td><?php echo anchor('blog/view/'.$post->id,'Read More'); ?></td>
			</tr>
			<?php endforeach; ?>
		</tbody>		
	</table>
	<!-- End view_many_posts.php -->

Our main template could be something like ::

	<!-- main_template.php -->
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>Our Awesome Blog using GasORM</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<div id="menu">
				<?php echo anchor('blog','View All Posts'); ?> | 
				<?php echo anchor('blog/create','Create New Post'); ?> 
			</div>
			<div id="content">
				<?php echo $content; ?>
			</div>
		</body>
	</html>
	<!-- End main_template.php -->


Creating And Editing A Post
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I generally put creating and editing in the same basket, as I think it makes for a cleaner and more uniform interface and a minimum of code. Lets add a couple of functions to our controller.  Assume as well that we have a login/auth system where we have saved our current user's id at in session data, retreived in CodeIgniter by calling **$this->session->userdata('user_id');** ::

	public function create()
	{
		// create a new blog object
		$post = new Model\Blog();
		
		// set the default information
		$post->user_id = $this->session->userdata('user_id');
		$post->title = 'New Post';
		
		// save the blog post to the database
		$post->save();
		
		// get the last id
		$post_id = Model\Blog::last_created()->id;
		
		// redirect to the edit screen
		redirect('blog/edit/'.$post_id);
	}

This is our post creation function.  It creates a new record, sets some default data and saves it to the database. It then redirects to the edit page where more detailed information can be added.  The only really new thing here is the call to the **save()** function.  Until we call this function our changes are just held in memory in the Model object.  Once we call **save()** our changes are saved into the database.

The edit function in our blog controller file looks like this: ::

	public function edit($id = 0)
	{
		$data['post'] = Model\Blog::find($id);
		
		// if we couldn't find a post, redirect
		if (is_null($data['post']))
		{
			show_404();
			return;
		}
		
		// check if we have posted data - i.e. hit save
		if ($_POST)
		{
			// parse the post data
			$data['post']->title = $this->input->post('title');
			$data['post']->body = $this->input->post('body');
			
			// try to save the record, running inbuilt validation
			if ($data['post']->save(TRUE))
			{
				// validation successful
				$this->session->set_flashdata('success','Successfully saved record');
				redirect('blog/view/'.$data['post']->id);
			}
		}
		
		// validation unsuccessful or no data posted, show the form
		$data['content'] = $this->load->view('edit_post', $data, TRUE);
		$this->load->view('main_template', $data);
	}

All of this is fairly straightforward, we basically populate the **$data['post']** variable from our **$_POST** data, and then call *save()*.  Note the difference with this save call and the save call made in the **create** method is that we have passed TRUE as an argument.  Passing TRUE in the optional parameter triggers Gas to run CodeIgniter form_validation before saving.  The rules applied are defined way back in the ORM::field arrays we defined in our models.  If our validation fails, save() returns false and we show our form again with some validation hints.  

We can then build a basic view to display our editor form :: 

	<!-- edit_post.php -->
	
	<?php if (validation_errors()) : ?>
	<div class="error"><?php echo validation_errors(); ?></div>
	<?php endif; ?>
	
	<?php echo form_open('blog/edit/'.$post->id); ?>
	
		<legend for="title">Post Title</legend>
		<br>
		<input type="text" id="title" name="title" value="<?php echo $post->title; ?>" />
		
		<legend for="body">Post Body</legend>
		<br>
		<textarea id="body" name="body"><?php echo $post->body; ?></textarea>
	
		<input type="submit" name="save" value="save" />
	<?php echo form_close(); ?>	
	<!-- END edit_post.php -->

As we have asked Gas to perform CI validation on our model, we perform a test at the top of the view for **validation_errors()**.  If there are any there we print them out to let the user modify their inputs.


Viewing A Single Post
+++++++++++++++++++++

The final piece of our blog controller is to let us show a single post.  We need to add a little bit to our blog controller to allow us to do this ::

	/*
	 * Displays a single posting in detail
	 */
	public function view($id = 0) 
	{
		// start by trying to find a blog object
		// with our passed ID.  If no object is 
		// found, GAS just returns NULL
		$data['post'] = Model\Blog::find($id);

		// check our blog is not null
		if (is_null($data['post'])) 
		{
			show_404();
			return;
		}

		// load the blog post table
		$data['content'] = $this->load->view('view_one_post', $data, TRUE);

		// view the master template
		$this->load->view('main_template', $data);
	}

And of course we need to write the associated view ::

	<!-- view_one_post.php -->
	<h1><?php echo $post->title; ?></h1>
	<p>Last Modified: <i><?php echo $post->modified_at; ?></i></p>
	<p><?php echo $post->body; ?></p>
	<!-- END view_one_post.php -->

And thats it! Our basic blog is completed using Gas ORM.


Some More Advanced Options
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What we have done so far only shows a little bit of the power of Gas, but in reality there is a lot more that can be done with this template.  If for instance we wanted to display posts by a given author, we could create a function in our blog controller similar to the *view($id)* function but replacing the following line: ::

	$data['posts'] = Model\Blog::find($id);

With something something like ::

	$data['posts'] = Model\Blog::order_by('created_at','DESC')->find_by_user_id($author_id);

Here we are using the **find_by_column** function where our column is **user_id**, mixed with some CodeIgniter active record code.  Equally, we could use our User model to perform the query: ::

	$data['user'] = Model\User::with('blog')->all();

This *eager loads* a user model joined with the relevant blog records (reducing the number of queries made to the database).  We could then access our post array by calling ::

	$data['posts'] = $data['user']->blog();

Gas also comes with a number of extensions which make building views even easier.  Much of what we did in our *view_many_posts.php* view file can be done with a single line of code from the html extension.  Have a look at the documentation for more information.
