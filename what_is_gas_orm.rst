What is Gas ORM ?
=================

A **lighweight** and **easy-to-use** [#easy]_ ORM for CodeIgniter. Gas was built specifically for CodeIgniter app. It uses standard CI DB packages and benefits from the CI form_validation class. Gas ORM provide a set of methods that will map your database tables and its relationships into accesible objects.

Gas ORM is Object Relational Mapping...
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) in computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates a **"virtual object database"** that can be used from within the programming language. [#orm_wikipedia]_ 


Gas ORM follows the Active Record pattern...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Active record is an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class. Thus, **an object instance is tied to a single row in the table**. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon saving. Any object loaded gets its information from the database. When an object is updated the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view. [#ar_wikipedia]_ 

Gas ORM is highly-optimized...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Scaling a database is an expensive and difficult process. If you already doing indexing, normalization and other schema optimization, then Gas ORM will respect these and put them to a good use. When reading/scanning your table and its relationships records, Gas ORM uses neither repetitive queries nor joins, because they can be slow. Instead, **Gas ORM  sends a constant number of simple queries (one query for each table type). This implies that volume of transferred data is minimized and the number of queries stays low no matter how many rows are processed**. This approach will increase your application performance. And if you still want to make it more better and efficient, there are per-request caching options, which make sure no same query executes twice.

Gas ORM is for CodeIgniter...
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CodeIgniter is most often noted for its speed when compared to other PHP frameworks. In a critical take on PHP frameworks in general, PHP creator Rasmus Lerdorf spoke at frOSCon in August 2008, noting that he liked CodeIgniter "because it is faster, lighter and the least like a framework." Gas ORM is perfect choice, if you want to have a **stable** [#save]_, **light** and **fast** ORM for your CodeIgniter application.  

Gas ORM is Open Source...
